#NBT Exploits Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I‚Äôve uploaded a collection of NBT exploits, kits, and more! This repository is designed for educational purposes only to help enthusiasts learn about Minecraft's NBT structure and mechanics.
# Warning

Please avoid using multiple exploits or NBT items, such as hotbar NBTs, simultaneously. Doing so may overload the game and cause crashes. Always handle these files responsibly!
